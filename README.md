### Summary

I am writing a [path tracer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_tracing) in Go. The Go gopher below was rendered using it, and here's the code that was used to do it: [gopher.go](https://github.com/fogleman/pt/blob/master/examples/gopher.go). It's 2560x1440px... so you can make it your wallpaper!

### TODO

Here are things that I'm planning, or at least hoping, to do.

* material properties *(partially done)*
* OBJ / STL models *(partially done)*
* textured objects *(partially done)*
* light attenuation
* depth of field
* constructive solid geometry
* input files to define scene
* animation support

### Summary

I am writing a [path tracer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_tracing) in Go.
I just started, so there isn't much to see yet.

### TODO

Here are things that I'm planning, or at least hoping, to do.

* material properties
* more shapes
* more example scenes
* OBJ / STL models
* textured objects
* constructive solid geometry
